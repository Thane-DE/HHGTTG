@localgov This is an outrage! You can't tear my house down without telling me first. Also, I don't think the docs that I found in that basement are valid.\n\n

Local Government:\n
@Arthur Why not? The plans were on display forever and you never said anything! Completely #yourownfault\n\n

Ford:\n
@Arthur @localgov Hey Arthur, let me handle this. I need to talk to you right now anyways. You trust me, right?\n\n

Arthur:\n
@Ford Oh, I'd trust you till the end of the world. Go ahead\n\n

Ford:\n
@Arthur Well, that's only 12 minutes away anyways. Now eat these...\n\n

Ford:\n
Captured in a Vogon spacecraft together with @Arthur right after witnessing the destruction of a planet. This job at #HHGTTG sure is exiting\n\n

Ford:\n
Freaking Vogon poetry - even worse than I imagined it to be...\n\n

Arthur:\n
@Ford SRSLY? MY HOME PLANET JUST BLEW UP AND YOU COMPLAN ABOUT THAT FRICKIN POETRY???\n\n

Ford:\n
@Arthur Eh, we're about to suffocate in space, so why bother. T minus 30 secs...\n\n

Tricia:\n
@Arthur @Ford Not today. Odds for survival are at #two hundred and seventy-six thousand seven hundred and nine against one\n\n

Zaphod:\n
And we did it! Welcome on board @Ford - and you too @Aartur\n\n

Arthur\n
@Zaphod Fair enough I guess... Name is @Arthur by the way
