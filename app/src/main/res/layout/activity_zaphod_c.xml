    <TextView android:text="By far the most unique character in the group of four. One could describe him as a combination between alien, hippie, and crazed adventurer. He is also the president of the Galaxy somehow. His characteristics can be very troubling to follow for strangers – he can seem to be extremely ignorant and dumb and the next moment he’s incredibly interested in completely trivial things. What remains is his extreme enthusiasm: He claims that he always just does things, no matter what. When he wanted to capture a heavily armed trading ship as a teen, he just did it not thinking of the consequences. When he wanted to become president of the galaxy, he just did it without really thinking about it. And when he wanted to steal the Heart of Gold – guess what – he just did it. He’s incredibly spontaneous and might very well be the definition of a hothead.  His “don’t think about it and just do it” attitude can also be seen towards other characters, most notably Tricia (who he refers to as “Trlilian”) and Arthur – not so much towards Ford, probably because they grew up together and he knows him very well. He is very open-minded towards Arthur and doesn’t treat him as a stranger – it seems like he doesn’t really care and just wants to do his own thing all the time." android:layout_width="wrap_content"
