    <TextView android:text="President of the Imperial Galactic Government. Inventor of the Pan Galactic Gargle-Blaster. Thief of the Heart Of Gold. Adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch. Once described by Eccentrica Gallumbits as, 'The Best Bang since the Big One,' and recently voted the Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Universe for the seventh time running.\n\n

His semi-cousin is Ford Prefect. They share three of the same mothers.\n\n

He has two heads, three arms, and an attitude. He claims he grew the third hand just for Trillian, but really, he grew it to improve his ski-boxing.\n\n
