            android:text="It has been some time since I've read a book the size of the HHGTTG. And it has been even longer since I actually enjoyed reading one. THHGTTG was the first book in a long time that actually entertained me and I feel like that's mostly due to the unique writing style of the book. In a way, it is written like a short story, a very long short story obviously but it still has some typical elements of those: While there is an overarching story, it does usually not play a prominent role and the writing focuses on the imminent events instead. Since chapters are also rather short, this made the book very enjoyable to read as it wasn't too heavy on text but instead was able to deliver fun and exciting moments over and over without getting boring. And thanks to its unique humour I also had to chuckle occasionally. From time to time it reads more like a parody on classical science-fiction novels and the next moment it is back to being a serious novel. And even though it feels like a humorous short story at first, the book doesn't fail to deliver an exciting story with a lot of twists and turns.\n\n
When I usually read a book, I either swallow it within a few hours/days or I struggle through it for several weeks to months. Needless to say, I usually swallow the books that I enjoy the most. And I'm glad to say that THHGTTG was one of those books. It was refreshing to read and I will probably go on with reading its successors very soon.
